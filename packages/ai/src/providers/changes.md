## 2026-10-07 - OpenGateway HTTP refresh failures retain status (senpi#2893)

### What changed

- `packages/ai/src/providers/opengateway-refresh.ts`: use the shared status-bearing HTTP error for catalog refresh failures without changing the message or last-good-catalog policy.

### Why

Refresh failure consumers need the original HTTP fact rather than message parsing.

### Why an extension could not handle it

The catalog's private fetch helper creates the failure.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `fetchJson` in `opengateway-refresh.ts`.


## 2026-10-08 - Official Kimi K3 cache-write price

### What changed

- `packages/ai/src/providers/kimi-coding.models.ts`: the hand-kept Kimi Coding `k3` row's API-equivalent `cost.cacheWrite` 0 -> 3, matching the official K3 price it estimates from.

### Why

- The official Kimi API price list (https://platform.kimi.ai/docs/pricing/chat) bills Kimi K3 cache writes at $3 per 1M tokens for the default 5-minute TTL ($6 for 1 hour); the catalog still had them at $0, which undercounted cost on requests that write the cache and failed the 2026.10.10-8 release regeneration once upstream data caught up.

### Why an extension could not handle it

- Built-in model prices are catalog data generated or kept in this package; nothing at runtime can correct them.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- LOW: the Kimi K3 cost constants when upstream reprices Kimi models.
